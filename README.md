# :game_die: NumberLucky
<h2>This app is a bet number generator.<br>
  I used the lottery betting rules of Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal to be able to generate numbers on all types of bets allowed by the Central Bank of Brazil</h2>

<h2>How to use?<br>
  Now, I'll be explaining how to use the app and what steps should be followed.</h2>
  
   <h4>:asterisk:This image illustrates what the app looks like when launched.<br>
    In it you can check the last numbers generated in your previous request.</h4>

  <h4>:asterisk:By clicking the option to enter the number of numbers you want to generate,<br>
    the application will immediately generate the number of numbers requested by the user.</h4>

  <h4>:asterisk:Finally the app will return with the requested numbers so you can bet.</h4>
